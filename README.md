# HOSPITAL-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
This project aims to develop a system that will simplify the management of patient records, appointments, and billing in hospitals. 
The current manual system for record-keeping is time-consuming and prone to errors and data loss. With this project, hospital staff will be able to access patient information easily, make follow-ups, and produce statistical results on disease outbreaks. The system will benefit hospital staff, administrators, and patients by providing a reliable platform for managing patient information.
